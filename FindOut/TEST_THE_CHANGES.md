# Test the Enhanced Busy Doctor Changes

## üö® IMPORTANT: The Changes Are Now Fixed!

The issue was that the backend was using a **different, simpler tone-decide function** in `main.py` instead of the enhanced one I created. I've now **replaced the main.py function** with the enhanced version.

## üîß What Was Fixed

1. **Backend**: Replaced the simple tone-decide function in `main.py` with the enhanced version
2. **Frontend**: Added debug logging to see what messages are being received
3. **Models**: Updated the data models to include all the new fields (cutNow, patience, engagement, etc.)

## üß™ How to Test the Changes

### Step 1: Start the Application
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
py -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser Console
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- You should see debug messages like:
  - `Realtime message received: conversation.item.created message assistant`
  - `MR message detected: [your message]`
  - `Hype detected (count: X): [your message]`

### Step 3: Test the Scenarios

#### Test 1: Get Hanged Up On (Should Work Now!)
**Say exactly this:**
```
"Hi Dr. Smith, I have this revolutionary new drug that's absolutely amazing and game-changing for your patients."
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Doctor: "I need specifics, not marketing. What's the actual data?"
```

**Then say:**
```
"It's the best treatment available, truly unbelievable results, breakthrough therapy..."
```

**Expected Result:**
```
Doctor: "I don't have time for this. Email me the trial results."
[2 seconds later - AUTO HANGUP]
```

#### Test 2: Get Engaged with Evidence
**Say exactly this:**
```
"Hi Dr. Smith, I'd like to discuss our Phase 3 trial results. It was a randomized controlled trial with n=500 patients, primary endpoint was progression-free survival with a p-value of 0.003."
```

**Expected Response:**
```
Doctor: "Good. Now tell me about the clinical significance and practical implications."
[Doctor becomes engaged]
```

## üîç What to Look For

### Console Logs (Should Now Appear)
- `Hype detected (count: 1): Hi Dr. Smith, I have this revolutionary...`
- `Hype detected (count: 2): It's the best treatment available...`
- `Medical evidence detected (count: 1): It was a randomized controlled trial...`
- `Doctor triggered cutNow - will auto-hangup in 2 seconds`

### Doctor's Emotional Responses (Should Now Work)
- **Hype words** ‚Üí Doctor becomes "Dismissive" and says "I need specifics, not marketing"
- **Evidence provided** ‚Üí Doctor becomes "Engaged" and says "Good. Now tell me about..."
- **3+ hype phrases** ‚Üí Doctor says ending phrase and auto-hangup triggers

### Auto-Hangup (Should Now Work)
- After 3+ hype phrases, doctor says ending phrase
- 2-second delay
- Call automatically disconnects
- Shows "Call ended due to patience exhaustion"

## üö® If It's Still Not Working

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these messages in the backend terminal:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "POST /api/tone-decide HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

### Check Frontend Console
Look for these messages:
```
Realtime message received: conversation.item.created message assistant
MR message detected: [your message]
Hype detected (count: X): [your message]
```

### Manual Testing
If automatic detection isn't working, you can manually test by opening the browser console and typing:
```javascript
// Get the realtime client instance
const client = window.realtimeClient; // or however it's exposed

// Manually track a hype message
client.trackMrMessage("This is revolutionary and amazing!");

// Manually track evidence
client.trackMrMessage("The trial showed n=500, p<0.001");
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior Now

1. **Hype words** ‚Üí Doctor gets frustrated and asks for specifics
2. **Evidence provided** ‚Üí Doctor becomes engaged and asks for more details
3. **3+ hype phrases** ‚Üí Doctor ends the call with auto-hangup
4. **Long monologues** ‚Üí Doctor cuts you off and asks for key points
5. **Repetition** ‚Üí Doctor gets frustrated and says "I heard you the first time"

The doctor should now behave like a **real busy senior physician** who will actually hang up on you if you waste their time!

## üîß If Still Not Working

1. **Restart both backend and frontend**
2. **Clear browser cache**
3. **Check console for error messages**
4. **Verify the backend is using the new tone-decide function**

The changes should now be working correctly!
