2. **Be concise** - Keep responses under 25 words
3. **Avoid hype words** - No "revolutionary", "amazing", "best"
4. **Use medical terms** - Endpoints, biomarkers, guidelines, safety
5. **Watch the doctor's mood** - Adjust approach based on responses

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå "This is the best drug ever"
- ‚ùå Long monologues without evidence
- ‚ùå Repeating the same vague claims
- ‚ùå Ignoring doctor's requests for specifics
- ‚ùå Using marketing language instead of medical data

---

## ‚úÖ Good Phrases to Use

- ‚úÖ "The trial showed n=500, p<0.001"
- ‚úÖ "Primary endpoint was progression-free survival"
- ‚úÖ "Safety profile shows 15% adverse events"
- ‚úÖ "This aligns with treatment guidelines"
- ‚úÖ "Biomarker analysis showed genetic mutations"
- ‚úÖ "Real-world registry data demonstrates efficacy"

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Doctor Isn't Getting Frustrated
1. **Check console logs** - You should see `Hype detected (count: X)` messages
2. **Restart backend** - Make sure the new tone-decide function is loaded
3. **Clear browser cache** - Refresh the page completely
4. **Check backend logs** - Look for `POST /api/tone-decide HTTP/1.1" 200 OK`

### If Auto-Hangup Isn't Working
1. **Check console** - You should see `Doctor triggered cutNow - will auto-hangup in 2 seconds`
2. **Wait 2 seconds** - There's a 2-second delay before hangup
3. **Check patience count** - Make sure you've used 3+ hype phrases

### If Evidence Detection Isn't Working
1. **Check console** - You should see `Medical evidence detected (count: X)`
2. **Use exact phrases** - Try "n=500", "p-value", "primary endpoint", "adverse events"
3. **Check spelling** - Make sure you're using the exact medical terms

### Manual Testing (If Automatic Detection Fails)
Open browser console and type:
```javascript
// Get the realtime client instance
const client = window.realtimeClient;

// Manually track a hype message
client.trackMrMessage("This is revolutionary and amazing!");

// Manually track evidence
client.trackMrMessage("The trial showed n=500, p<0.001");
```
